# Agentic Wiki Builder: Agent Architecture & Philosophy

The Agentic Wiki Builder is designed around a **filesystem-driven, evidence-based agent architecture**. Rather than relying on a centralized orchestration framework or runtime memory, agents coordinate asynchronously using the repository's files and decoupled git repositories as a declarative state-sharing layer.

---

## 1. Core Agent Personas
Agents operate as functional layers of the evidence-to-action pipeline:

*   **Researcher**: Discovers peer-reviewed literature and stages raw sources.
*   **Synthesizer**: Ingests raw sources and compiles objective knowledge into the Wiki.
*   **Protocol Architect**: Translates Wiki findings and user profile constraints into step-by-step, personalized protocols (e.g., using menumaker tools to compute optimal nutritional meal plans).
*   **Auditor**: Runs automated validation, audits citation integrity, and checks link structures.

---

## 2. Filesystem-Driven Handoff Model
The coordination is asynchronous, mediated by the file structure:
*   **Staging (`sources/`)**: Ground for raw evidence and metadata.
*   **Manifest (`sources/state.json`)**: Orchestration queue for pending ingestion.
*   **Wiki (`wiki/` repository)**: Objective knowledge base (anonymized, theory-focused).
*   **User Workspace (`user/` repository)**: Personalized deliverables (user profiles, feedback, actionable protocols).
*   **Temporary Workspace (`tmp/`)**: Used for temporal edits, temporary data storage, or scratchpad operations when the user is adding information or data.

## 3. Strict Conventions & Rules of Engagement

### Hierarchy of Evidence & Citation
*   **Citations**: Protocols cite the Wiki (`wiki/`); the Wiki cites Sources (`sources/`).
*   **Format**: Use `markdown-it` footnotes (`[^1]`) for citations and relative markdown links (`[Text](../path.md)`) for cross-references. Every mention of another wiki page in body text must be a clickable relative link — no unlinked page references. Never use inline URLs, external links, or `[[wikilinks]]`.
*   **Naming**: Use `snake_case.md` for all files.

### Evidence & Truth
*   **No Fabrication**: Do not invent sources, quotes, or metadata. If verified source evidence is missing, halt and request the raw document.
*   **No Stubs**: Skip sources with `status: stub` or failed extraction.
*   **No Web Search**: Discover literature using dedicated research tools; never search the web directly.
*   **Document Conversion (MarkItDown)**: Always use `markitdown` (via `.venv/bin/markitdown <file>`) to convert and read PDF, Word, Excel, or other document formats to Markdown. Do not write ad-hoc Python parsing scripts (e.g., using PyPDF2, pdfplumber, openpyxl) to extract text or values from documents.

### Separation of Responsibilities
*   **Wiki (Objective)**: Must remain anonymous and objective. Present competing hypotheses with confidence markers (`> ⚠️`). Do not include user-specific data.
*   **Protocols (Actionable)**: Personalized, step-by-step instructions. Cite the Wiki for backing, but omit scientific justifications within the protocol itself.
*   **User Profile**: Persist only structural, recurring traits (goals, constraints, physiology). Never save anecdotal one-off events.

### Workspace Structure & Version Control
*   **Always Synchronize First**: Before executing any task that modifies the repository or its data repositories, you must synchronize with the remote (e.g., `git pull` in the root and relevant data directories) to avoid conflicts and ensure you are working on the latest state.
*   **Decoupled Repositories**: The `wiki/`, `user/`, and `sources/` directories are independent git repositories. They are completely ignored by the main project's git index. Commits must be made directly within these decoupled repositories to serve as a status log of agent operations.
*   **Index Catalogs**: Every directory must contain an `_index.md` listing its contents with one-line summaries. Do not place task/progress markers in index catalogs.
*   **Folder Bloat Limit**: Maximum of 15 content files per directory (excluding `_index.md`). Restructure into subdirectories when this limit is exceeded.
*   **YAML Frontmatter**: Every non-index markdown file in `wiki/` and `user/` must begin with a standardized YAML frontmatter containing `title`, `category` (relative directory path under collection root), `related` (list of linked internal relative files), and `rationale` (concise single-sentence design philosophy/organizational justification). This frontmatter is validated by `lint_check_links` and is indexed for search via `wiki_update_index`.

## 4. Behavioral Principles

*   **Verify Before Synthesis**: Confirm source extraction is successful and contains content before citing. State assumptions explicitly.
*   **Simplicity and Conciseness**: Synthesize the minimum required text. Protocols must contain only the necessary actionable steps. Avoid speculative padding.
*   **Surgical Edits**: Touch only the files and lines required for the task. Do not make cosmetic edits to adjacent sections. Clean up orphaned links or footnotes created by your changes.
*   **Goal-Driven Execution**: Define validation criteria (e.g., link integrity, index updates) before starting a task and verify them iteratively until they pass.
