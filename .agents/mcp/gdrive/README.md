# Google Drive MCP Server (Read-only)

A FastMCP server that provides read-only access to files and folders in Google Drive, with automatic conversion of Google Docs/Sheets to Markdown/CSV, saving them directly to the `sources/internal_documentation/` directory.

## Setup Instructions

Choose **one** of the authentication methods:

### Method 1: Automatic OAuth 2.0 Client (Recommended & Easiest)
1. Run the interactive setup helper:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   Or run the authentication script directly:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python .agents/mcp/gdrive/server.py --auth
   ```
2. The script will automatically launch a browser window using pre-configured, built-in application client credentials.
3. Log in with your Google account, authorize read-only access to Google Drive, and the server will automatically save `token.json` under `.agents/mcp/gdrive/`. No manual API key or credentials download is needed!

### Method 2: Custom OAuth 2.0 Client (Using your own GCP Project)
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project.
3. Set up the **OAuth consent screen** (Internal or External, add your email, and add the scope `.../auth/drive.readonly`).
4. Go to **Credentials**, click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
5. Select **Desktop app** as the application type, download the credentials JSON, rename it to `credentials.json`, and place it in this directory:
   `.agents/mcp/gdrive/credentials.json`
6. Run the authentication flow:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python .agents/mcp/gdrive/server.py --auth
   ```

### Method 3: Google Service Account (Recommended for Headless Automation)
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project.
3. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
4. Click **Create Credentials** > **Service account**.
5. Name it, then click on the newly created Service Account.
6. Under the **Keys** tab, click **Add Key** > **Create new key** (select JSON format).
7. Download the JSON key file, rename it to `service_account.json`, and place it in this directory:
   `.agents/mcp/gdrive/service_account.json`
8. Share the Google Drive files/folders you want the agent to access with the service account's email address (e.g. `your-service-account@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
